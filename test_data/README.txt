*** SAMPLE FILES ***

Sample data taken from two publicly available projects from NCBI:
* Single-end reads: BioProject ID: PRJEB28510; SRA Study: ERP110720; Experiment: ERX2807158; # https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/?run=ERR2798139
* Paired-end reads: BioProject ID: PRJNA431965; SRA Study: SRP131649; Experiment: SRX3606823; # https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/?run=SRR6519218

Due to size limits imposed by GitHub, to make our test data, we extracted the first 200,000 reads from each paired-end FastQ file. The single-end test file is the same as the one from NCBI.

*** REFERENCE FILES ***

The test reference file provided is a text file with two accession numbers, which correspond to polyomaviruses JC virus (NC_001699.fasta) and BK virus (NC_001538).
